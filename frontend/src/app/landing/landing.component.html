<p>Landing pages, a digital scourge</p>
<p>With flashing banners, and endless blur</p>
<p>Of neon lights, and stock images bright</p>
<p>A symphony of chaos, a never-ending sight</p>
<br>
<p>The typefaces bold, and claims so grand</p>
<p>An endless scroll, a digital bland</p>
<p>Of clich√© phrases, and hollow fame</p>
<p>A facade of nothingness, a digital shame</p>
<br>
<p>The call-to-actions, the buy-now buttons galore</p>
<p>The endless barrage, the endless allure</p>
<p>Of endless scrolling, and pop-up ads</p>
<p>A labyrinth of links, nothing's what it seems, that's sad</p>
<br>
<p>But still we're drawn, like moths to a flame</p>
<p>To the endless scroll, and endless claim</p>
<p>Of happiness, success, and wealth untold</p>
<p>A digital dystopia, where nothing's what it's sold.</p>
